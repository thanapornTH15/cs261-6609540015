# Repository for individual work in CS261 course  
This repository has two branches: 'master' and 'master-frontend'. Each branch contains files in the work process, which are divided into two phases:
1. 'master' : Frontend part to interact with users
2. 'master-frontend' : Frontend part that adds Backend code to allow web pages to call/verify data with the TU's database by calling the TU API and displaying the identity verification results on the web page.

## This is 'master' branch  
This branch contains the `frontend folder` that holds the initial web page file version, which was developed based on the UI prototype. These files include basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSON, and image assets, but they do not include back-end functionality or the latest updates.

Files included:
- .html
- .css
- .js
- .json
- .png (images)
- .gitignore

For the latest version of the project, which includes full functionality and TU API integration for authentication, please refer to the *master-frontend* branch.
