# Repository for individual work in CS261 course
This repository has two branches: 'master' and 'master-frontend'. Each branch contains files in the work process, which are divided into two phases:
1. Frontend part to interact with users
2. Frontend part that adds Backend code to allow web pages to call/verify data with the TU's database by calling the TU API and displaying the identity verification results on the web page.

## This is 'master-frontend' branch
This contains two folders:
- Frontend: .html / .css / .js / .img / .json / .gitignore
- Server-Setup: .dockerfile (docker image for build & run on Docker)

You can install the latest version of this project by cloning only the master-frontend branch using the command:
`git clone -b master-frontend https://github.com/thanapornTH15/cs261-6609540015.git`
or select the download option via **Code > Download Zip** and then extract the zip file to access the working folder.
